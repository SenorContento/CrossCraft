<title>Minecraft Server Webpage</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="black" text="white">
<p>So, this is going to be the webpage for my CrossCraft server. I am not worrying about making it look nice right now as I am going to use one of those Progressive Web Apps not only on my main site <a href="https://senorcontento.com/">https://senorcontento.com/</a>, but here too. It may be awhile before I actually make this website as I also need a good (and cheap) Minecraft host that can support Sponge.</p>

<p>I currently have found <a href="https://www.hosthorde.com/">HostHorde</a> which looks like a great deal for allowing me to get a good server. If you have any better suggestions please <a href="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01RRXr6piINN439QWpEosbpA==&c=7WfwIN0A5I-jHODNKDHcGDTnecMGAN30ORwvqo3Jvx0=">email me</a>.</p>

<p>I may also make the server (or a variant of the server) public if I get a lot of support and requests. Although I am still limited by the fact that I don't have any money (I am just getting into college, so I should be able to get a job).</p>

<p>The purpose of this website is to
<ul>
<li>Explain the server</li>
<li>Show how to connect (all variants pc, pe, public, private, etc...)</li>
<li>Give links to important resources (e.g web maps such as dynmap)</li>
<li>Give indication about online status and log of online status</li>
<li>Give voting links for public server</li>
<li>Give a list of all plugins and teach how users can interact with plugins</li>
</ul>
